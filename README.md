# Important
This is still very much a working progressing as evidenced from the mess in some of the files.  The extraction of the data using *importing_AMITEX_data.py* works fine but still requires some functionality added.


# Main concept
This is based on Chris Simpson's *CPEX* which is an extraction and plotting tool for crystal plasticity in ABAQUS.  Much of the functionality developed as part of this tool will be based/adapted from his original work.
